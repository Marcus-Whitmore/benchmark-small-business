            <p> My name is Marcus Demetrius Whitmore and I am from Detroit,Mi. I have been working in the hair business
                for years and loved seeing the improvement of hair grow ,but one day an idea struck my mind. Some men in
                the world have troubles getting waves slighty because of their hair textures or they because they just
                dont have patience enough to wait. Days of thinking I came up with the project durag that would give a
                person 360s waves in seconds its a ripple effect swirly icon that moves on the crown of the person head.
                After of many times testing its work great saving the buyer rest on the brushing and the sadiness of
                having waves.
